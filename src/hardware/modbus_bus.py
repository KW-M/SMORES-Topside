"""Async Modbus RTU wrapper for one RS485-to-USB converter.

One `ModbusBus` instance exists per configured `serial_port_devices` entry.
Wraps a pymodbus `AsyncModbusSerialClient`. Because RS485 is half-duplex,
every request on the port is serialized behind an `asyncio.Lock`: a caller
awaits the lock, sends its request, awaits the response (or timeout), then
releases the lock — so a concurrent caller (the sampler loop, an API poll)
can interleave at the request level without corrupting either party's
response, per ARCHITECTURE.md §4.

Two Blue-RDO-specific behaviours live here rather than in
`hardware.rdo_blue`, because both are properties of the *link*:

- **No retries.** The client is constructed with `retries=0`, so a
  non-answering instrument costs exactly one request timeout and surfaces
  as `SensorTimeoutError`, per AGENTS.md's "Do not retry reads".
- **Wake-up handling.** The instrument idles into a low-power state after
  `END_OF_SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` without traffic, so at any sampling
  interval longer than that every read would otherwise fail. This class
  tracks the last answered command *per Modbus address* and, when that
  address's session has lapsed, sends one throwaway Device Id read as the
  vendor doc's "any Modbus command" wake-up, waits
  `WAKEUP_SETTLE_SECONDS`, then sends the real request exactly once. The
  wake delay is awaited *outside* the bus lock, so unrelated addresses keep
  using the port while an instrument wakes.

`tests/unit/test_modbus_bus.py` monkeypatches the module-scope
`AsyncModbusSerialClient` name below with a fake client, so those tests
never open a real serial port.
